This is the repository of a wireless EMG device built for our module **BM2210-Bio Medical Device Design**. The device senses the forearm muscle signals on flexion and extension and then goes through an amplification and filtering part which at last will be transmitted to a laptop where the classification happens.

## Circuit Design






## Breadboard Implementation

The breadboard implementation was used in the early stages for prototyping and testing the EMG signal acquisition, filtering, and wireless transmission before finalizing the PCB. It serves as a reference for understanding the initial circuit layout and testing procedure.
